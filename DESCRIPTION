Version: 1.1
Description: Provides a full package of posterior inference, model comparison, and graphical illustration of model fitting. A parallel computing algorithm for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior inference and an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm for posterior approximation are are developed, both of which greatly reduce the computational time for model inference.
