\usage{
TransZ(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The probability of a down-regulated gene jumping to null gene}
}
\value{
A 3*3 transition matrix for Z
}
\description{
Compute a special transition matrix of Z: symmetric, down-regulated genes are not able to jump directly to up-regulated genes; a probability of a down-regulated gene jumping to null gene equals the probability of a up-regulated gene jumping to a null gene.
